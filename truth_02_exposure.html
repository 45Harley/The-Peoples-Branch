  <h1>Rung 2: Error as Error</h1>

  <p>Somewhere along the way, harm was recast—diluted, denied, renamed as something else. But truth doesn’t forget. This rung is about stripping the varnish. What was the lie? What was minimized, spun, spiritualized, or sealed away?</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Where was the lie? The denial? The rewrite of reality?”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Prompt</h2>
    <p>Name the distortion. Even if it protected you once. Even if it was spoken by someone you trusted.</p>
    <p>This isn’t about blame—it’s about bringing reality back into focus, one shard at a time.</p>
