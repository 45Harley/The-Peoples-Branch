Absolutely, Harley—here’s a clear, visual-style **flow of the Auto Feeds Subsystem** for Watchtower, showing how it operates now and how it might evolve. This blends your current system with future connectors and spiritual design intentions.

---

### 📡 **Auto Feeds Subsystem: Operational Flow**

#### 1. `feeds.yaml` – **Curated Source Registry**
- Each entry includes:  
  `name`, `url`, `region`, `moral_lenses[]`, `bias`, `factual_rating`
- Optional metadata: `heartbeat_status`, `last_active`

➡ feeds into...

#### 2. `feeds-loader.js` – **Fetch & Parse Layer**
- Pulls RSS content from each feed in `feeds.yaml`
- Parses latest posts into simplified insight objects:
  - `title`, `summary`, `pubDate`, `source`, `resonance`, `moral_lens`, `moral_polarity`

➡ generates...

#### 3. `auto-insights.json` – **Live Data Injection**
- Holds real-time or recent civic threads
- Structured like `insights.json` for frontend parity

➡ passes into...

#### 4. `watchtower.js` – **Dashboard Rendering Engine**
- Loads both `insights.json` and `auto-insights.json`
- Applies user-defined filters from `user-preferences.json`:
  - Region, intensity threshold, moral lens, Care Circle scope
- Renders insights into cards + modals

🟣 Matches trigger Care Circle visuals  
🧭 Tags like "warn" or "grieve" affect tone/framing

---

### 🔁 **Support Modules (Parallel & Optional)**

#### 🔄 `feed-pulse.js` – Feed Health Monitor
- Tracks update rhythm of each feed
- Flags inactive or sporadic feeds (🟡, 🔴)
- Updates `feeds-status.json` for UI filtering

#### 🧠 `source-trust-index.yaml` – Ethical Overlay (Future)
- Stores external credibility ratings (e.g. MBFC, AllSides)
- Enables UI filters: “Show only high factuality” or “Balance my bias”

#### 🧬 `moral-lens-engine.js` – Optional NLP Tagger (Future)
- Auto-assigns moral_lens + polarity based on article content
- Enables fully live polarity surfacing from raw feeds

---

### 🌐 **Future Nodes / Integrations**
- 🔌 **User-Contributed Feeds**: via a “Suggest Feed” form or UI modal
- 🕊️ **Grotto Archive Mapping**: feed-derived insights archived for reflection or translation
- 🔭 **Care Circle Map Layer**: geographic rendering of source coverage + feed activity
- 📦 **Webhooks to External Tools**: send filtered insights to email digests, Mastodon, or Obsidian vault

Would you like this flow visualized as a diagram for your documentation—or shaped into a markdown page for `feeds-system.md`? I can lay it out like a process map or a topographical sketch, tuned to your metaphorical style.

===================
Perfect. Here's a **markdown page draft** for your docs—this could live as `feeds-system.md` alongside your manifest, or be integrated into your `README.md` as a subsystem chapter:

# 🛰️ Auto Feeds Subsystem

*A living mesh for real-time civic signal and moral resonance*

---

## 📦 Components Overview

### `feeds.yaml` — Source Registry  
A curated list of RSS sources, each with:
- `name`, `url`
- `region`
- `moral_lenses`
- `bias`, `factual_rating`
- *(optional)* `last_active`, `heartbeat_status`

### `feeds-loader.js` — Ingestion Engine  
Fetches feeds listed in `feeds.yaml`, parses latest entries, and outputs:
- `auto-insights.json` — aligned with Watchtower format

### `watchtower.js` — Frontend Renderer  
- Loads `insights.json` + `auto-insights.json`  
- Applies user filters from `user-preferences.json`  
- Tags Care Circle matches and renders insight cards

---

## 🔁 Support Modules

### `feed-pulse.js` — Feed Health Monitor  
- Checks freshness of each feed  
- Flags sources as 🟢 Active / 🟡 Sporadic / 🔴 Dormant  
- Updates optional `feeds-status.json`

### `source-trust-index.yaml` *(Planned)*  
- Records bias and factuality ratings from AllSides / MBFC  
- Powers user filters like “only show High factuality” or “include cross-bias sources”

---

## 🧠 Enrichment Layer *(Planned)*

### `moral-lens-engine.js`  
- Natural Language Processing for moral polarity + lens inference  
- Enables real-time tagging of incoming RSS threads

---

## 📍 User Experience Path

1. **User loads Watchtower dashboard**
2. `feeds-loader.js` fetches latest feed items
3. `auto-insights.json` delivers live threads into Care Circle view
4. Insights from trusted, up-to-date sources are rendered as cards
5. UI allows filtering by trust, region, polarity, and heartbeat

---

## 🗺️ Future Expansions

- 🌍 Geographic mapping of feed coverage
- 🧭 Source Explorer for user-submitted civic feeds
- 🕊️ Archival Grotto view for signal reflection
- 🔄 Webhooks or digests for outbound alerts

Would you like this written into a markdown file and added to your docs with the same voice and formatting as your `watchtower-manifest.md`? I can lay it out in full or drop it into a Copilot Page for editing. We’re shaping a lantern system that breathes.
