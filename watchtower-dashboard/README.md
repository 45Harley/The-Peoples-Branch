# 🧭 Watchtower Dashboard

*A dynamic civic signal observatory for threads of governance, insight, and moral resonance.*

This is an interactive dashboard for exploring live civic insights—interpreted through open-source data, ancestral wisdom, frontline reports, and moral framing. It is built as part of a larger framework of ladders, summits, grottos, and signal architectures.

## ✨ Features

- Modular card-and-modal system powered by `insights.json`
- Clean separation of structure (`index.html`), logic (`watchtower.js`), and content (`insights.yaml`)
- Dynamic rendering of insights with resonance index and moral lenses
- Compatible with GitHub Pages for public viewing
