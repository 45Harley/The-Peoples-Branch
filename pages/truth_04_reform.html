  <h1>Rung 4: Reform Imagined</h1>

  <p>This rung isn’t about retribution—it’s about refusal. Refusal to repeat harm, refusal to rebuild the old house with old plans. Here we design: systems, habits, safeguards, symbols, ceremonies. Reform is imagination with integrity.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “What might restoration look like—not only for the harmed, but for the whole?”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Prompt</h2>
    <p>Sketch a possible future: what structures would make the harm less likely? What truths need to be baked into our blueprints, our norms, our tools?</p>
    <p>You are not alone in this. Others will build from what you offer.</p>
