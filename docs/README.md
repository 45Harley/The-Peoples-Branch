# Documentation

Reference material for the framework, including conceptual diagrams, visual maps,  
glossaries, onboarding notes, and narrative orientation layers. Intended for both contributors  
and spiritual readers of the terrain.
# Ladders

This directory contains modular ladder definitions for the framework.  
Each ladder represents a structured ascent through a specific form of participation  
(e.g., inquiry, stewardship, translation). Files in this folder will follow YAML patterns  
set in `ladder-system.yaml` (v0.2).
# Scenes

This folder holds standalone definitions of individual zones—like valley, grotto, summit, etc.—  
so they can be referenced, edited, and reused modularly. Scene files may override or extend  
topography-level defaults in `framework-topography.yaml`.
# Templates

Reusable YAML logic fragments, metadata blocks, banners, and symbolic permission sets.  
Useful for modularity and consistency across ladders, scenes, and user flows.
