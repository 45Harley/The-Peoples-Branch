  name: "The Light Held Still"
  context: "Offered after completing the ‘Through the Fire’ truth ladder"
  description: >
    Not applause. Not reward. A stillness. A wordless moment
    where the truth remains visible—and you remain whole.

    This gesture isn’t shared by others. It’s felt within:
    A breath. A word. A slight nod to no one in particular.

  prompt: "Pause. Breathe. Whisper one word you want to carry forward."
  optional:
    - action: "Hold a candle or flashlight steady for 30 seconds"
    - action: "Write that one word in a corner of your journal or page"
    - action: "Mark the end silently. Let no one else know—it’s still real"
