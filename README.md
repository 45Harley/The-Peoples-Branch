
## 🌿 Participatory Terrain

Each folder represents a dimension of this participatory topography:
-
- **Valley** — quiet origins, listening spaces, first witness  
- **Path** — sequences of movement and invitation  
- **Ladder** — deliberate ascent through transformation  
- **Summit** — moments of clarity, declaration, or offering  
- **Grotto** — hidden, sacred, regenerative spaces  
- **Crossroads**, **watchtowers**, and **fire circles** may emerge over time

These metaphors are embedded in both content and structure. Each YAML file reflects not just configuration, but *spiritual positioning*.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can view this system in two primary ways:

1. **Explore it as a repository**  
   Browse the folders and read through the YAMLs, HTML pages, and markdown files. Begin at `start-here.md` or explore the `truth-map.html`.

2. **Run it locally via GitHub Pages**  
   This site is designed to render HTML artifacts for narrative walkthroughs. Ensure your repo is GitHub Pages–enabled (from the `/root`), and visit the published URL to experience the transformation ladders and narrative paths.

## ✍️ Contributing

This is an evolving commons. To participate:

- Fork the repository  
- Create a `profile-[yourname].yaml` in `/users/`  
- Propose a new scene, ladder, or ritual thread  
- Or simply offer edits, comments, or blessings  

We welcome both poetic gestures and technical refinements.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This framework is guided by deep traditions of truth-telling, communal healing, sacred memory, and iterative witnessing. Many voices have shaped its topography—seen and unseen.
