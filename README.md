# The People’s Branch

*A shared space for reflection, connection, and growth—built by all, for all.*

---

## 🌱 What This Is

The People’s Branch is a living framework designed to help people pause, notice, and share what matters.

It’s not a platform.  
It’s not a system.  
It’s a space to breathe, speak, listen, and rise—together.

## 🪜 What You’ll Find Here

- **Ladders**: Reflection journeys made of small, clear steps (we call them rungs).
- **Roles**: You can join as a visitor, participant, guide, or steward.
- **Voices**: Every prompt is offered in different styles—plain, poetic, analytical, or playful.
- **Choices**: You decide what to share, and what to keep for yourself.

Everything here is meant to be elder-friendly, kid-welcoming, and gentle on the soul.

## 🛠️ How to Use This

1. Start with any ladder step in the `ladder-manifest.yaml`.
2. Read the prompt in your favorite voice style (from `ladder-voices.yaml`).
3. Reflect, respond, or just sit with the question.
4. If you're contributing, check `roles.yaml` to see your role and what's possible.

You don’t have to be a “systems person.”  
You just have to be a person.
