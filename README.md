# 🌿 The People’s Branch

A participatory framework for healing, truth-telling, learning, and shared ascent.  
This is not a product. It's a space. An invitation. A ladder placed gently at your feet.

---

## ✨ What is this?

**The People’s Branch** is a modular constellation of ladders—each one designed for reflection, reformation, and regeneration. It centers plain language, soft entry points, cyclical steps, and roles for both humans and AI.

You don’t need credentials to begin. You begin wherever you are.

## 📚 Ladders Available

Each ladder is a self-contained journey:

- **Through the Fire: A Truth-Witness Ladder**  
  For naming harm, witnessing error, turning toward reform, and holding healing.  
  → Starts at [`truth_01_witness.html`](pages/truth_01_witness.html)

- **The Ladder That Waited**  
  For those arriving late, circling back, or unsure where to begin.  
  → Starts at [`bl_01_arrival.html`](pages/bl_01_arrival.html)

**This branch is not a hierarchy.  
It’s a resting place for those choosing to ascend, together.**
