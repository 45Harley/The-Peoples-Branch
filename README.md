Now let’s update `start-here.md`. Here’s a clean draft that mirrors the above but focuses on helping contributors and testers get oriented fast.

Would you like it to include CLI steps for local server testing (e.g. `python -m http.server`) or keep it ultra simple for now? Let me know and I’ll finish that file next.
