# 🌿 The People’s Branch

Welcome to a participatory sanctuary for reflection, ascent, and shared imagination.

**“You begin wherever you are.”**

---

## 🔍 What is This?

**The People’s Branch** is a modular, ladder-based framework for collective exploration and co-creation. Each ladder reflects a theme or principle—Truth, Celebration, Consent, Transparency—and invites active engagement.

Participants may take on evolving roles:  
**Seeker · Climber · Witness · Maker · Custodian**  

Each role scaffolds different ways of seeing and building together.

---

## 🧩 Interactive Ladders

The ladders are organized as `YAML`-driven structures to ensure clarity, adaptability, and collaborative remixing. Browse the ladders:

- [`truth-path.yaml`](./truth-path.yaml)
- [`celebration.yaml`](./celebration.yaml)
- [`roles.yaml`](./roles.yaml)

- **Consent** as compass  
- **Mutual recognition** as soil for growth
