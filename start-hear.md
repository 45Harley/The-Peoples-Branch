# Start Here

Welcome to **The People’s Branch**—a space for reflection, connection, and shared becoming.

This guide is for anyone curious, cautious, or just arriving. No systems knowledge needed. Just a willingness to pause and explore.

## 🪜 What’s a Ladder?

A ladder is a gentle path made of small steps (we call them *rungs*). Each rung invites reflection—on your story, your values, or your place in the world.

You can walk a ladder alone, with a friend, or in a group. You can speak, write, or just think quietly.

## 🎭 Choose Your Role

Check the `roles.yaml` file to see what fits you best:

- **Observer**: Look around, no pressure to share.
- **Participant**: Reflect and respond to prompts.
- **Facilitator**: Guide others through the ladder.
- **Steward**: Help shape and care for the space.

## 🗣️ Choose Your Voice

Each ladder prompt is offered in four styles:

- **Plain**: Clear and simple
- **Poetic**: Metaphor-rich and lyrical
- **Analytical**: Structured and thoughtful
- **Playful**: Light, curious, and kid-friendly

You can pick one voice—or switch as you go. See `ladder-voices.yaml` for all the options.

## 🧭 How to Begin

1. Open `ladder-manifest.yaml` to see the available rungs.
2. Pick a rung that speaks to you.
3. Choose a voice style from `ladder-voices.yaml`.
4. Reflect. Respond. Or just sit with the question.
5. If you want to share, check your role in `roles.yaml`.

---

## 🌿 What Comes After?

Every ladder ends with a **celebration**—a way to mark what mattered. You’ll find those in `celebration.yaml`.

You can also explore:

- `wish-map.yaml` for future dreams
- `sanctuary.yaml` for shared values
- `weaving-log.yaml` to see how this space is evolving
