  description: >
    For moments when healing requires confrontation. When error must be named, 
    not excused. When the first kindness is clarity. This ladder holds space 
    for offense—not to offend, but to awaken.

  prompts:
    entry: "Are you willing to face what has been hidden—by yourself or others?"
    caution: "This path may stir discomfort. That’s not failure. That’s movement."
    readiness_check: 
      - "Do you feel safe enough to name the harm?"
      - "Are you speaking as the harmed, the one who harmed, or a witness?"

      url: "pages/truth_01_witness.html"
      reflection: "Describe the harm—not abstractly, but in its impact."
      notes: "This is not a space to defend or deflect. Just name."

      reflection: "Where was the lie? The denial? The rewrite of reality?"
      notes: "You may feel resistance. Note it. That’s the edge of the old self."

      reflection: "What needs to be released? Admitted? Faced inwardly?"
      notes: "Repentance is not penance—it’s return to truth, and willingness to change."

      url: "pages/truth_04_reform.html"
      reflection: "What might restoration look like—not only for the harmed, but for the whole?"
      notes: "This is the architectural phase—designing structures that refuse to repeat the harm."

      reflection: "What does healing mean—if not forgetting?"
      notes: "This ladder ends, not with closure, but with continuity."
