  name: "Civic Sanctuary"
  description: >
    A universal space for belonging, reflection, and shared ascent.  
    This isn’t a destination. It’s a resting node—a pattern of trust, presence, and return.

  entry_path: "pages/bl_01_arrival.html"
  tone: "gentle, invitational, steady"

  purpose:
    - Welcome newcomers gently, without presumption or pressure
    - Link to ladders suited for various states (grief, readiness, harm, curiosity)
    - Frame roles as invitations, not assignments
    - Preserve dignity through plain language and choice

  includes:
    - ladder_manifest: "ladder-manifest.yaml"
    - roles_file: "roles.yaml"
    - celebration_file: "celebration.yaml"

  gestures:
    invitation: "You are already in. If you choose to stay, the space will grow around you."
    reassurance: "Nothing here demands urgency. Stillness is honored too."
