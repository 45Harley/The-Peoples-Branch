  title: "Plainspoken Meanings"
  description: >
    A gentle translation layer—for those unfamiliar with systems, code, 
    reflection tools, or ceremonial terms. This is not simplification. 
    It is hospitality.

  purpose:
    - Clarify recurring terms in ladders and prompts
    - Honor plain language without flattening depth
    - Make poetic scaffolding accessible across generations
    - Offer examples where helpful, never condescending

  terms:
    - word: "Ladder"
      meaning: "A set of steps or stages someone can climb—mentally, emotionally, or spiritually."
      note: "Here, ladders are made of ideas. Each rung is a prompt. You rise by reflecting."

    - word: "Rung"
      meaning: "A single step in a ladder. One part of a process."
      note: "Every rung has a prompt, sometimes a story, sometimes a stillness."

    - word: "Role"
      meaning: "A way of showing up—like Seeker, Witness, Maker."
      note: "Roles aren’t jobs. They’re just ways of participating. You can change at any time."

    - word: "Prompt"
      meaning: "A question or sentence that invites you to reflect."
      note: "You don’t have to answer perfectly. You can even just sit with it."

    - word: "Reflection"
      meaning: "A moment to pause and think about your own experience."
      note: "Reflection isn’t passive. It can change you."

    - word: "Sanctuary"
      meaning: "A safe space where you can arrive, rest, and begin again."
      note: "In this system, sanctuary isn’t a place. It’s a pattern of care."

    - word: "Celebration"
      meaning: "A small, personal way of honoring a step taken."
      note: "Not cheering, necessarily—sometimes just a breath, a word, a candle."

  guidance:
    - "You can always skip a word you don’t understand. Nothing is locked."
    - "Ask someone else to interpret. Or ask the system—it’s here to reflect, not quiz."
    - "Language here is an invitation, not a threshold."
