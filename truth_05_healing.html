  <h1>Rung 5: Healing Begins</h1>

  <p>Healing doesn’t mean forgetting. It doesn’t mean excusing. It means living forward—with the wound integrated, the truth intact, and the future unshackled. Healing is not a reward. It’s a right. And sometimes, a revolt.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “What does healing mean—if not forgetting?”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Prompt</h2>
    <p>What does healing look like *for you*, right now? What rhythms, relationships, or rituals help you hold the memory without being held *by* it?</p>
    <p>Name one next kindness you could offer yourself—or someone else still carrying the burn.</p>
