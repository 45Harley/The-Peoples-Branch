  <h1>Rung 1: Harm Witnessed</h1>

  <p>This is not a space to defend or deflect. It is a space to name what was true. To stop making excuses—for ourselves or others. To remember the impact, not the intention. To speak with clarity that does not require permission.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Describe the harm—not abstractly, but in its impact.”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Prompt</h2>
    <p>What happened that wounded you—or someone else? Where does the ache live now?</p>
    <p>Write it in a way that a future self could understand, and not look away.</p>
