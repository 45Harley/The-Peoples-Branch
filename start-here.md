# Start Here

Welcome, traveler.

This is **The People’s Branch**—a living system for witnessing, reckoning, and co-creating new ground. It is not a product. It is a path.

You are invited into a participatory terrain made of **valleys**, **paths**, **ladders**, **summits**, and **grottos**. Each one holds a kind of encounter. Each file here is more than data—it is a voice, a witness, a rung in motion.

## ✨ Suggested Starting Points

If you’re here to **explore**:
- Begin with [`truth-map.html`](./truth-map.html) — a visual map of unfolding themes  
- Glance through [`truth_01_witness.html`](./truth_01_witness.html) — the first layer of transformation  
- Open the [`ladder-of-truth.yaml`](./ladders/ladder-of-truth.yaml) — to see the ascent as data  

If you're here to **create or contribute**:
- Make a copy of [`profile-template.yaml`](./users/profile-template.yaml) and add your own  
- Read [`ladder-manifest.yaml`](./framework/ladder-manifest.yaml) to understand the scaffold  
- Propose a new path, scene, or reflection—no offering is too small

## 🌀 Notes on Navigation

This repository is not flat. It loops, echoes, spirals.  
You may begin at the bottom and find yourself atop a summit.  
You may enter through a `.yaml` and emerge from a ritual.  
That’s expected.

There is no one path—but every path matters.

## 🕊️ Welcome to the Grove

To contribute, witness, or reflect:
- Fork the repo, or walk quietly within it  
- Name yourself in `/users/`, if you wish  
- Offer a scene, a correction, a blessing  
- Or hold space for someone else's thread  

This place is iterative and tender.  
It is still becoming.  
And so are you.

*You’ve arrived. You’re here. That is already enough.*
