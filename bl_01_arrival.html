  <h1>The Ladder That Waited</h1>

  <p>This ladder doesn’t demand urgency. It doesn’t count the days you were gone. It doesn’t ask why you’re only arriving now. It just unfolds the rung in front of you and says: “Welcome. You’re already in motion.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Start here. Start gently. Even if you’re unsure what you’re starting.”
  </blockquote>

  <div class="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection Prompt</h2>
    <p>What brings you here today? Not the polished reason—just the flicker. The itch. The quiet knowing that something wants to move.</p>
    <p>If you want, write it down. Or just sit with it. No proof required.</p>
